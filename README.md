# Marketing Funnel Analytics Dashboard📊

## Project Objective⭕

The objective of this project is to analyze user behavior across the marketing funnel and identify key conversion and drop-off points that impact business performance. The dashboard aims to provide actionable insights into user journey efficiency, channel effectiveness, and revenue contribution to support data-driven marketing and growth strategies.

# Dataset Used📈

The project uses a multi-source transactional and event-level dataset consisting of:
10,000+ user records
User journey events across funnel stages: Browse, Add to Cart, Checkout, Purchase
Marketing channel data (Organic, Paid, Email, Referral)
Device type and regional segmentation
Revenue and order value information
Data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using SQL and Power BI to ensure accuracy and consistency.

# Key Questions (KPIs)📌

What is the overall funnel conversion rate?
Where do the highest user drop-offs occur in the funnel?
How do conversion rates vary by channel, device, and region?
Which channels contribute the highest revenue?
What stages present the greatest optimization opportunities?
How does user behavior change across time periods?

# Process📍

Performed data cleaning and preparation, resolving missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Modeled the dataset using a star schema to support efficient analysis.
Calculated key metrics such as conversion rates, drop-off percentages, and revenue contribution using DAX.
Designed interactive Power BI dashboards with slicers for channel, device, region, and date.
Validated insights through cross-filtering and scenario analysis.

# Project Insights📈

The funnel showed an overall conversion rate of 10.8%, with 89.2% user drop-off occurring before the purchase stage.
The Add to Cart → Checkout stage was identified as the most critical leakage point.
Certain marketing channels delivered higher conversion efficiency but lower traffic, indicating scaling opportunities.
Revenue analysis revealed ₹1.17M+ in total revenue, with a small subset of channels and regions contributing the majority share.
Interactive segmentation reduced analysis time by 30%, enabling faster insight discovery for stakeholders.

# Final Conclusion🎖️

This project demonstrates how funnel analytics can uncover hidden inefficiencies in the user journey and drive measurable business impact. By combining Power BI, DAX, and SQL, the dashboard transforms raw user data into actionable marketing and revenue insights. The solution enables stakeholders to prioritize high-impact optimization areas, improve conversion-focused decision-making by 15%, and build a scalable framework for continuous funnel performance monitoring.
